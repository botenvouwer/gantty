# Gantty
Generate an Excel sheet with gannt diagram.
I tried to build this natively in google sheets or in Excel. 
However, all the time I got stuck on the dynamic nature of dates and times.
And yes, I want my gannt to include days, weeks, months etc.
So I guess I just Python the shit out of this.

## How to use
Currently just install python and openpyxl.
Use pycharm to open the project and try to fiddle with the parameters until you are happy.
